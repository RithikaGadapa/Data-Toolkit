# Data Toolkit - README

This repository contains comprehensive notes and Python code covering key concepts in the Python data toolkit. It is structured to support academic learning and includes examples, code, and visualizations using industry-standard libraries.

---

## üìò Contents

* `Data Toolkit Theory`: Detailed explanations of 22 data toolkit topics with insights and practical examples.
* `Data Toolkit Practicals`: Python code implementations for essential data manipulation and visualization tasks using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
* `file.csv`: Sample CSV file used in the section on reading and displaying tabular data.

---

## üß† Theory Topics Covered

The theory section includes detailed explanations of topics such as:

* NumPy features and advantages
* Pandas DataFrames and group-based operations
* Statistical and interactive visualizations with Seaborn and Plotly
* Concepts like broadcasting, vectorized operations, hierarchical indexing, and pivot tables

Each explanation has been enhanced with clarity and includes examples where appropriate.

## üß™ Practical Topics Covered

The practical section demonstrates how to:

* Create and manipulate NumPy arrays
* Perform row-wise and element-wise computations
* Generate a variety of visualizations: scatter plots, bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, histograms, and 3D plots
* Filter and transform data in Pandas
* Upload and read CSV files in Google Colab

Each code block includes:

* Clean, commented Python code
* Console outputs to aid interpretation
* Visual plots where relevant

## üìÇ How to Use in Google Colab

1. **Upload CSV file (e.g., file.csv):**

```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
```

2. **Read and display the file:**

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("file.csv")
print(df.head())
```
